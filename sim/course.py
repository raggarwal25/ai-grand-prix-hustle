"""
AI Grand Prix race course: gates, ordering, and pass-time tracking.

Gate dimensions follow VADR-TS-002 §3.7:
  - Outer:  2700 x 2700 mm (square frame)
  - Inner (flyable hole): 1500 x 1500 mm
  - Depth:  260 mm

Gates are placed as static visual entities. Pass detection runs as a regular
@el.map system that watches the drone's `world_pos`, advances `last_gate_passed`
when the drone crosses the next-in-order gate's plane within the inner square,
and stamps the crossing time in `gate_pass_time`.

The drone starts at the ENU origin. The default course places vertical gates
straight ahead along +X (East) at hover altitude.
